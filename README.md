# Post-Wildfire Recovery
This is a collaborative Earth Lab Certificate project by [Eric Gottlieb](https://github.com/esgeo) and [Heidi Yoon](https://github.com/AreteY) studying post-wildfire recovery.

# Project Motivation and Goal
* Wildland fire is a multifaceted natural phenomenon of increasing importance to both human and ecological communities. In this project, we explore the post-wildfire recovery for the [2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/chimney-tops-2-fire.htm) by spatially quantifying the vegetation recovery using hyperspectral reflectance data and by categorizing the burned areas by expected fire intensity using weather, topography and fuels data.
* This project highlights how high spatial resolution (1-meter) remote sensing measurements, such as LiDAR topography and hyperspectral reflectance data, can be used to study fire recovery on the order of the spatial variation on the ground and how lower resolution (30-meter) data, such as weather and fuels, can be integrated to inform and guide a study over a large spatial area.
* In this repository, we include [example notebooks](https://github.com/AreteY/post-wildfire-recovery/tree/main/notebooks) that process and analyze LiDAR topography, hyperspectral reflectance, weather data, biophysical and vegetation models to assess post-wildfire recovery.

# Project Workflow
The overall workflow of the project is shown below.

<img src="graphics/workflow.png" width="100%">

The project workflow consists of two stand-alone workflows, Workflow A for vegetation recovery and Workflow B for fire intensity, that can each be used separately and together to relate vegetation recovery to fire intensity in specific regions of the burned area.

Workflow A is a vegetation recovery analysis in which the vegetation recovery of an 1000-m by 1000-m area within the burn perimeter can be evaluated first by calculating vegetation indices ([NBR: normalized burn ratio](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/vegetation-indices-in-python/), [NDVI: normalized difference vegetation index](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/vegetation-indices-in-python/), [MSAVI: modified soil adjusted vegetation index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034425794901341)). Then the index that can best discriminate between unburned and burned areas is determined by the [random forests algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324). Finally, [multiple endmember spectral band analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425798000376?via%3Dihub) is used to classify the vegetation at a sub-pixel level into green growth [green], standing dead or dormant vegetation [deadwood], or burned areas [char].
* To use Workflow A, run the [notebook](https://github.com/AreteY/post-wildfire-recovery/tree/main/notebooks)  `vegetation_indices.ipynb` to calculate the vegetation indices using a downloaded reflectance file and plot the results using matplotlib and earthpy.

Workflow B quantifies key environmental variables in the fire environment using ([LiDAR Digital Elevation Model](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30024.001/RELEASE-2022) 1-m spatial resolution data for topography, (LANDFIRE grids) 30-m spatial resolution data for fuels, and time series data (RAWS wind direction) for weather. Understanding the burned area antecedent physiographic and biophysical conditions for the Chimney Tops 2 Fire allows one to relate variability in fire effects to these environmental variables that theoretically affected the fireâ€™s intensity.The fire spread vector is quantified by determining the average wind direction from the Indian Grave Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS) site on November 28th (with the assumption that wind direction is a proxy for spread direction). For the Chimney Tops 2 wildfire and other applications, the workflow assumes a consistent wind vector during the period in which the fire burned through the area being analyzed in order to ascertain the spread direction. The spread direction is used in conjunction with 1-m NEON LiDAR Elevation data (NEON Elevation- LiDAR: DP3.30024.001) to classify slopes as a function of their alignment with the wind direction, which is an important factor in fire intensity. Theoretically the most intense fire behavior based on wind and slope alone would have occurred in places where the wind was blowing directly upslope (i.e., azimuth of wind and aspect are subequal) because convective heating from , which we classify as head fire environments. Conversely, in locations where the wind was blowing downslope (i.e., ~180 degrees between wind azimuth and aspect), fire behavior is theoretically expected to be least intense (because the site should be sheltered from wind and convective preheating is minimal), which we classify as backing fire environments. The intermediate condition between head and backing fire environments would have occurred on slopes where the aspect was orthogonal to the wind direction, which we classify as flanking fire. The raster reclassification approach we use for this step is as follows:

Head fire environment: Aspect - Wind Azimuth >-45 and <45
Flanking fire environment: Aspect - Wind Azimuth (>45 and <135) or (<-45 and >-135)
Backing fire environment: Aspect - Wind Azimuth >135 or <-135

A secondary classification using LiDAR data can be made based on steepness of slope. Head fire environments with the steepest slopes theoretically represent the areas of highest intensity. Based on established research, we will classify slopes >25 degrees in head fire environments as representing the maximum intensity environment as one end member, whereas slopes between 10-20 degrees in backing fire environments are thought to represent minimal burning conditions and are an opposite end member. Having these two end members allows us to incorporate a third variable into our analysis- that being fuels (i.e, vegetation type and condition)- to test how post-fire recovery correlates to theoretical burn intensity. Mapping the reference conditions biophysical setting (LANDFIRE BPS) of the Chimney Tops fire area and how the vegetation has departed from its historical conditions (LANDFIRE VDEP)) allows us to focus on forested areas that have experienced the most (or least) departure from their natural range of variability. The key hypothesis that will be tested is whether post-fire recovery in head fire environments on steep slopes show significant differences from backing fire environments on moderate slopes in areas with similar biophysical and vegetation departure characteristics. Our analysis will ultimately involve plotting results of the three different vegetation indices measured in Workflow A versus our various environmental variable end members.
* To use Workflow B, run the [notebook](https://github.com/AreteY/post-wildfire-recovery/tree/main/notebooks)  `wind_terrain_fuels.ipynb` to reclassify the burned area of interest using a downloaded LiDAR DEM, time series wind data, and LANDFIRE fuels raster data and plot the areas of head, flanking and backing fire in the various fuel types using matplotlib and earthpy.

# Example Usage
Workflow A
* The vegetation indices of any NEON Airborne Observation Platform Hyperspectral Reflectance hdf5 file can be calculated by Workflow A. This could include the [NEON spectrometer orthorectified surface directional reflectance - mosaic data product](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30006.001) used in this workflow and the [NEON spectrometer orthorectified surface directional reflectance - flightline](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.30006.001) data product.
* In addition, any boundary shapefile for the Reflectance hdf5 file could also be plotted with the reflectance in Matplotlib using the [notebook](https://github.com/AreteY/post-wildfire-recovery/tree/main/notebooks) `vegetation_indices.ipynb`.

Workflow B
* A given area analyzed by Workflow A (typically 1 km^2 tile), or selected independently, can be analyzed in Workflow B to reclassify the area at 1-m spatial resolution by slope, aspect and at 30-m by fuels conditions into areas of expected theoretical fire intensity.
